# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction
This project is focused on detecting fraudulent transactions using credit card data. With the increasing number of digital payments, the need for robust fraud detection systems has become imperative. We've developed a solution that utilizes machine learning and graph modeling to identify potential frauds.

## Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification to set a benchmark for more complex algorithms.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method for classification that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees.
- **Neural Network**: A deep learning approach to capture complex patterns in the data.
- **Graph Modeling with XGBoost**: An innovative method that uses graph-based features along with gradient boosting for fraud detection.
